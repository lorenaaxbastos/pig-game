This project was undertaken during The Complete JavaScript Course 2024, instructed by Jonas Schmedtmann.

### What did I learn during this project?

This introductory project taught me the basics of DOM manipulation, including event handling for clicks using the addEventListener method, selecting elements from the DOM tree using the querySelector method, changing the content of elements using their properties such as textContent, using regex to replace text in strings, etc.

Although it's a simple project, it was crucial for practicing the fundamentals of DOM manipulation and gaining a better understanding of how the JavaScript language is applied in the frontend.
